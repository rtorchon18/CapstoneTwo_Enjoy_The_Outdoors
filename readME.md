## Challenges Faced

### 1. **Data Management:**
   Managing a large dataset of mountains, each with its unique information, coordinates, and images, proved to be a complex task. Ensuring data consistency and integrity required a lot of attention to detail.



### 2. **Frontend Design:**
   Crafting an engaging and user-friendly frontend was a significant challenge. Balancing aesthetics with functionality, creating responsive layouts, and ensuring a seamless user experience required continuous refinement and troubleshooting.

### 3. **Image Handling:**
   Incorporating images for each mountain posed challenges in terms of me not getting it completed. 

### 4. **Interactive UI:**
   Implementing an interactive UI for users to explore and select mountains required integrating JavaScript functionalities. Handling user interactions and dynamically updating content added a layer of complexity.

### 5. **Git Workflow:**
   Collaborative development brought its own set of challenges, especially with a team spread across different locations. Resolving merge conflicts, maintaining a clean commit history, and ensuring smooth collaboration were ongoing tasks.

   ## New Grooves

### 1. **Z Index:**

The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex and grid items. Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one. (Think of it like using layers in Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator)

### 2. **Psuedo Code:**
 
 I used the ::after element in my nav bar underneath the different sections of the website!
